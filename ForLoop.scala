/* YIELD
 * 
 * For each iteration of your for loop, yield generates a value which will be remembered. 
 * It's like the for loop has a buffer you canâ€™t see, and for each iteration of your for loop another
 *  item is added to that buffer. When your for loop finishes running, it will return this collection of all the yielded
 *   values. The type of the collection that is returned is the same type that you were iterating over,
 *    so a Map yields a Map, a List yields a List, and so on.
